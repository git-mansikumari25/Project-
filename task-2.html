<h1> MY CITY</h1>
<h2> Gaya Ji</h2>
<p>Gaya, one of Bihar's most sacred cities, will now be officially known as 'Gaya Ji'. The name change honours the town's religious heritage and deep-rooted cultural sentiments.
Gaya is famous for its profound spiritual significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism, particularly as a major pilgrimage site. It's known for being the place where Lord Buddha attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, and for Hindus, Gaya is the location of the Pind Daan ritual, which is performed to honor and bring peace to the souls of ancestors.
